The code provided is written in Java and parses an XML file to extract elements, sort them based on the value of the "SHORT-NAME" tag, and create a new XML file with the sorted elements. 

In addition, the code includes custom exception classes "NotValidAutosarFileException" and "EmptyAutosarFileException" to handle errors related to file extension and empty files respectively.

The main method of the program reads an XML file from the specified path and uses the DocumentBuilder and NodeList objects to traverse the elements and extract data. It then creates a new ArrayList to store the elements, iterates through the NodeList, and adds any elements that are of the "CONTAINER" type to the ArrayList. The elements are then sorted based on the value of the "SHORT-NAME" tag using a custom Comparator implementation.

A new XML Document is created using the DocumentBuilder, and the sorted elements are added to it. Finally, a new XML file is created using a Transformer object, and the sorted elements are written to it.

Before parsing the XML file, two custom exception classes are used to check for invalid file extensions and empty files respectively. If either of these conditions are met, an exception is thrown and the program will terminate. If no exceptions are thrown, the program will proceed with parsing and sorting the XML file.
